        <h3>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="text-start taskp mt-4 mb-5">
        <p>
          In this task, we implemented the function `rasterize_triangle` so
          that we can render a triangle to screen space given 3 points in (x,
          y) coordinate space.
        </p>
        <p>
          I solved this task by checking for triangle winding, finding the
          bounding box to sample the pixels in, and checking whether each
          pixel passes the three line test, which was covered in lecture.
          First, to make sure the vectors representing the edges of the
          triangle are counter-clockwise, I used the right hand rule and the
          cross-product. The sign of the cross-product indicates the winding
          direction and in my case, since I want the winding to be in
          counterclockwise, I check if the cross-product sign is negative
          (indicating counterclock wise) and if it is I swap the position of
          vertices ie x becomes y and y becomes x. This is to ensure
          counter-clockwise winding for the three line test. Once this is
          taken care of, I found the boundaries of the given vertices: the
          smallest x and y and the biggest x and y. This is so that I can
          sample points within this bounding box without having to start from
          (0,0) and ending at (w,h) of screen space. Using this bounding box,
          I iterate through each point and for each point, I find sample
          points by adding 0.5 to x and y. Then, I perform the three line test
          and if the test passes, I call `fill_pixel` helper function to set
          the color of a pixel. Since this algorithm tests each pixel in the
          bounding box, it is no worse than one that checks each sample within
          the bounding box of the triangle.

        <h3>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="text-start taskp mt-4">
        <p>
          In this task, we implemented supersampling to get rid of the
          "jaggies" that we saw from task 1. In other words, we antialiase by
          supersampling.
        </p>

        <p>
          To support supersampling, I had to modify set_sample_rate,
          set_framebuffer_target, resolve_to_framebuffer, rasterize_triangle,
          and add a helper function called fill_supersample_pixel.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            `set_sample_rate`
            <p>
              This function is called when we want to change the supersample
              rate or when we press = during the runtime of the draw program.
              The only change needed here to support supersampling is to
              ensure that when the sample buffer is resized, it is resized to
              a size of width * height * rate where width and height are the
              dimensions for the frame buffer while rate is the sample rate.
              This calculation is needed to support the increased number of
              samples.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            `set_framebuffer_target`
            <p>
              This function is called when the draw program window is resized.
              When the program window is resized, we have to resize the sample
              buffer as well and to support supersampling, the sample rate is
              accounted for in the resize calculation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            `rasterize_triangle`
            <p>
              Since supersampling is sampling multiple points within each
              pixel and averaging them, we need to modify this function to
              have nested for loops in order to iterate over each pixel inside
              the bounding box. Then, we test these subpixels with the three
              line test again and if they are within the triangle, we color
              them using `fill_supersample_pixel`.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            `fill_supersample_pixel`
            <p>
              This is a helper function I added. This functions similarly to
              the `fill_pixel` function except it supports supersampling; the
              function makes it so that all the supersampled pixels, or
              subpixels, correspond to the pixel in the frame buffer and are
              changed to the same color. In order to do this, I need to change
              the way I index into the sample buffer. This is done by
              accounting for sample rate and keeping track of the sample
              within the pixel (x, y). This means that I take in one extra
              parameter which I call `s` and we keep track of it inside the
              inner loops for the subpixels.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I used the sample_buffer and resized it by doing width * height *
          sample_rate so that there is enough memory for the subpixels. I also
          modified the rasterize_triangle function to have two for loops
          inside the loops for iteration through the pixels. These two inner
          loops are for iteration through the subpixels; within them, I find
          the sample point for each subpixel. Then, I perform the 3 point test
          and if it passes, I call on fill_supersample_pixel to fill the
          subpixel with the specified color. I also keep track of the index of
          the current subpixel so that in fill_supersample_pixel, I can index
          into the correct sample_buffer. The function resolve_to_framebuffer
          is also modified by taking our subpixels and averaging them down.

        As supersampling rate increases, the triangle edges are smoother.
        This is because supersampling is essentially taking a higher
        resolution and then downsampling and averaging it to the output
        resolution of the frame buffer.
