        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4 mb-5">
          <p>
            In this task, we implemented the function `rasterize_triangle` so
            that we can render a triangle to screen space given 3 points in (x,
            y) coordinate space.
          </p>
          <p>
            I solved this task by checking for triangle winding, finding the
            bounding box to sample the pixels in, and checking whether each
            pixel passes the three line test, which was covered in lecture.
            First, to make sure the vectors representing the edges of the
            triangle are counter-clockwise, I used the right hand rule and the
            cross-product. The sign of the cross-product indicates the winding
            direction and in my case, since I want the winding to be in
            counterclockwise, I check if the cross-product sign is negative
            (indicating counterclock wise) and if it is I swap the position of
            vertices ie x becomes y and y becomes x. This is to ensure
            counter-clockwise winding for the three line test. Once this is
            taken care of, I found the boundaries of the given vertices: the
            smallest x and y and the biggest x and y. This is so that I can
            sample points within this bounding box without having to start from
            (0,0) and ending at (w,h) of screen space. Using this bounding box,
            I iterate through each point and for each point, I find sample
            points by adding 0.5 to x and y. Then, I perform the three line test
            and if the test passes, I call `fill_pixel` helper function to set
            the color of a pixel. Since this algorithm tests each pixel in the
            bounding box, it is no worse than one that checks each sample within
            the bounding box of the triangle.

          <h3>Task 2: Antialiasing by Supersampling</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4">
          <p>
            In this task, we implemented supersampling to get rid of the
            "jaggies" that we saw from task 1. In other words, we antialiase by
            supersampling.
          </p>

          <p>
            To support supersampling, I had to modify set_sample_rate,
            set_framebuffer_target, resolve_to_framebuffer, rasterize_triangle,
            and add a helper function called fill_supersample_pixel.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              `set_sample_rate`
              <p>
                This function is called when we want to change the supersample
                rate or when we press = during the runtime of the draw program.
                The only change needed here to support supersampling is to
                ensure that when the sample buffer is resized, it is resized to
                a size of width * height * rate where width and height are the
                dimensions for the frame buffer while rate is the sample rate.
                This calculation is needed to support the increased number of
                samples.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              `set_framebuffer_target`
              <p>
                This function is called when the draw program window is resized.
                When the program window is resized, we have to resize the sample
                buffer as well and to support supersampling, the sample rate is
                accounted for in the resize calculation.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              `rasterize_triangle`
              <p>
                Since supersampling is sampling multiple points within each
                pixel and averaging them, we need to modify this function to
                have nested for loops in order to iterate over each pixel inside
                the bounding box. Then, we test these subpixels with the three
                line test again and if they are within the triangle, we color
                them using `fill_supersample_pixel`.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              `fill_supersample_pixel`
              <p>
                This is a helper function I added. This functions similarly to
                the `fill_pixel` function except it supports supersampling; the
                function makes it so that all the supersampled pixels, or
                subpixels, correspond to the pixel in the frame buffer and are
                changed to the same color. In order to do this, I need to change
                the way I index into the sample buffer. This is done by
                accounting for sample rate and keeping track of the sample
                within the pixel (x, y). This means that I take in one extra
                parameter which I call `s` and we keep track of it inside the
                inner loops for the subpixels.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I used the sample_buffer and resized it by doing width * height *
            sample_rate so that there is enough memory for the subpixels. I also
            modified the rasterize_triangle function to have two for loops
            inside the loops for iteration through the pixels. These two inner
            loops are for iteration through the subpixels; within them, I find
            the sample point for each subpixel. Then, I perform the 3 point test
            and if it passes, I call on fill_supersample_pixel to fill the
            subpixel with the specified color. I also keep track of the index of
            the current subpixel so that in fill_supersample_pixel, I can index
            into the correct sample_buffer. The function resolve_to_framebuffer
            is also modified by taking our subpixels and averaging them down.

          <p>
            In this task, we have to implement rasterizing a triangle with
            colors defined at the vertices and interpolate the pixel colors
            using barycentric coordinates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Barycentric coordinates is basically a proportion between a point
            inside a triangle and the triangle's vertices. The way I think about
            barycentric coordinates is to imagine the triangle as a physical
            object with mass distributed at its three vertices. This way, the
            point given by barycentric coordinates, or the point inside the
            triangle, would be the center of mass. In other words, barycentric
            coordinates ensure that the point inside the triangle is the center
            of mass of the triangle. This is why barycentric coordinates consist
            of three scalar values: alpha, beta, and gamma representing the
            "weights".
          </p>

          <p>
            This implementation is similar to `rasterize_triangle` except that
            once we are in the innermost loop and after finding the sample
            points as well as performing the three line test, we calculate
            alpha, beta, and gamma based on the formula in lecture. We then use
            these alpha, beta, and gamma values to find the center of mass which
            would be the color that we want our `fill_supersample_pixel` to use.

          <h3>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4">
          <p>
            In this task, we have to implement pixel sampling using two methods:
            nearest neighbor or bilinear interpolation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pixel sampling is when you apply a texture into screen space. You
            take a pixel and its corresponding color from the texture and map it
            to the pixel in screen space. This requires the color information,
            ie where it is located in texture space, from the texture to
            determine the final color of a pixel. To do this, I had to find the
            barycentric coordinates (alpha, beta, and gamma) of the sample
            point. After this, I have to convert to the sample point to texture
            space by using these alpha, beta, and gamma values. Once the sample
            point is converted to texture space which is represented by (u, v)
            coordinates, we then apply texture sampling using either nearest
            neighbor or billinear interpolation method.
          </p>
          <p>
            In nearest neighbor sampling, we simply take the closest (u, v)
            coordinate and sample the texture at that point. On the other hand,
            in bilinear interpolation, we get the four closest (u, v)
            coordinates and then do a weighted average (through linear
            interpolation) and then sample.
          </p>
          <p>The following functions were implemented for pixel sampling:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              `rasterize_textured_triangle`
              <p>
                This function is very similar to the other rasterize triangle
                functions except it converts to (u, v) coordinates. These
                coordinates are passed onto the `sample` function.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              `sample`
              <p>
                This function returns the color for the pixel from the texture

            Between nearest sampling at supersample rate 1 and bilinear
            interpolation at supersample rate 1, we see that the latitude lines
            (horizontal white lines) are a bit more blurry or better antialiased
            for bilinear interpolation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, for the methods with supersampling rate 16, the differences
            are much harder to tell because supersampling already antialiases;
            however, bilinear interpolation is still better. For example, if you
            look at some of the longitude lines closely, it is a bit more
            blurry.

          <p>
            With these observations, there will be large differences when the
            supersample rate is at 1, or when there is no supersampling. Nearest
            sampling tends to produce blocky, pixelated, and sometimes jagged
            edges since it only takes the nearest texel and not consider other
            adjacent texels like bilinear interpolation does. This is especially
            noticeable when we zoom in with the pixel inspector at pixels where
            we move from high frequencies to low frequencies.

          <h3>Task 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4">
          <p>
            In this task, we have to implement level sampling to the pixel
            sampling algorithm from task 5.
          </p>

          <p>
            Level sampling works by sampling from different levels, or
            resolutions. These different resolutions are stored in a something
            called a mipmap. We use the mipmap to sample at lower resolution for
            higher frequencies.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              `rasterize_textured_triangle`
              <p>
                I implemented level sampling by additionally finding the barycentric coordinates for the sample point's neighbors.
                These neighbor barycentric coordinates are used to calculate the level in the `get_level` function.
                These neighbor barycentric coordinates are first used to find the rate of change of u and v in respect to x and y 
                respectively. This is so that we know which level in the mipmap to use. Larger derivatives result in larger level 
                values and therefore lower resolutions. This is implemented in `get_level`.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              `get_level`
              <p>
                We use the derivatives mentioned above and using the level calculation in lecture to find the level.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              `sample`
              <p>
                Once we find which level to sample from, we can either use the two
                methods from before: nearest or bilinear interpolation. With nearest level, L_NEAREST, we use the nearest level to sample from.
                With L_LINEAR, we take two levels above and below the level returned
                by `get_level` and interpolate them.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            With level sampling implemented, we can have in total 3 level sampling
            methods and 2 pixel sampling methods.

            This is for the first row of images. On the left image, if we focus on the edge as well as the eye, we
            can see that there is better antialiasing in L_ZERO and P_LINEAR.
            As mentioned eariler in the task 5 section, this is because
            P_NEAREST does not do interpolation like P_LINEAR and only takes
            one point from the texture. Therefore, we see some
            staircases/jaggies in the left image whereas in the right image,
            the staircases/jaggies are antialiased.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is for the last row of images. In the left image, because we used L_NEAREST instead of level 0,
            we can sample at lower resolutions which is why we don't see
            staircases unlike the left image using L_ZERO. Similar to how
            there is interpolation for P_LINEAR, there is also interpolation
            for L_LINEAR but instead with levels which is why there is much
            better antialiasing for the right image.
          </p>          
          </div>


          <p class="mt-5">
            With everything implemented, we can discuss the tradeoffs between
            speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between supersampling,
            pixel sampling, and level sampling. Supersampling is a powerful
            antialising technique; however, it requires more memory to store the
            higher resolution image. It is also computationally more intensive
            due to the number of increased number of samples per pixel. Pixel
            sampling is not as effective compared to supersampling especially
            for high frequency pixels. It sacrifices some antialiasing power.
            Because of this and because it does not sample subpixels, it
            requires less computational power and no additional memory. Level
            sampling antialiasing power is more of a balance of supersampling and pixel
            sampling in that it precomputes multiple texture resolutions and
            stores them in a mipmap and utilizes them to reduce aliasing across
            different viewing distances. Therefore, it is better aliasing power
            without having to worry about needing more computational power at
            the expense of requiring additional memory for the mipmap.
