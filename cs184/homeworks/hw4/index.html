<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
  In this project, I simulated a piece of cloth under some constraints. For example, 
  I simulated how the cloth behaves when two points of it are pinned against a wall 
  and how it reacts when it falls onto nothing or onto another object. Since we render this based on physics,
  we can change the animation of the cloth such as gravity, damping, and density. In the first part of the
  project, I first have to build the cloth by using a grid of point masses and springs. Then, I added
  physics of motion to it by using Verlet integration. Finally, I added shaders to add more visual effects to the cloth.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
  <p>In this part, we created a grid of point masses and springs for a sheet of cloth by dividing 
    the cloth up into evenly spaced point masses and and then connecting nearby masses with springs. 
    Essentially, a cloth is made up of point masses each connected to other point masses via springs.
    We use 3 different type of springs: structural, shearing, and bending to further constrain the cloth
    and to prevent any deformations the cloth may have.

<h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation Via Numerical Integration</h2>
  <p>
    After setting up a system of point masses and springs, we can now simulate motion by applying the forces 
    on our cloth's point masses to figure out how they move from one time step to another. First, I compute 
    the total force acting on each mass. Here, we have external forces which are the parameters we can change
    in real-time during simulation such as gravity and internal forces which are the forces from the spring
    acting on the point masses. After computing the force acting on each point mass, I then used Verlet
    integration to compute each point mass's change in position. Verlet integration is used instead of other
    methods such as Euler's method because it is fairly accurate and easy to implement since we can approximate
    our current velocity by change in position (current position - position from last time step). We also add
    damping to help simulate loss of energy due to friction.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then, to prevent the springs from being deformed during each time step, I implemented a feature based on
    the SIGGRAPH 1995 Provot paper which constrains each spring to be at most 10% of its rest length and 
    perform any corrections to the point masses connected by that spring if needed.

    On the other hand, a lower damping percentage such as 0% makes the cloth fall really fast and makes it swing back and forth. In addition, there are 
    more ripples and bounces as it swings. This makes sense as the damping percentage controls how fast the springs lose energy; with a higher damping percentage,
    the springs lose their energy faster and therefore, the cloth does not ripple and bounce as much as a cloth with a smaller damping percentage.

<h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling Collisions With Other Objects</h2>
  <p>
    After implementing how different forces act on the cloth, we implemented how our cloth behave 
    when interacting with other objects and in this case, with planes and spheres.
    Essentially, with any type of object, we check if each point mass is inside the object and if so, 
    we adjust the point mass's position and ensure that it stays just on the surface of the object.
    If the point mass intersects/is inside the object, I compute the surface point of the intersection
    as the projection of the point mass position to the surface of the object. Then, I compute 
    the correction vector to update the point mass's last position to be the surface point. 
    The point mass's new position is then its last position added with the correction vector
    which is scaled down by a friction factor. 
  </p>

    <figcaption align="middle">Sphere collision at resting state with ks = 50,000</figcaption>

  <p>
    Increasing ks results in less wrapping of the cloth around the sphere while decreasing it makes the cloth wrap more around the sphere
    as well as have the edges drape more.

<h2 align="middle">Part IV: Handling Self-collisions</h2>
  <p>
    In part III, we only accounted for collisions with other objects but not with the cloth itself. 
    There can be a scenario in which the cloth falls onto itself and without self-collisions implemented, 
    we see the cloth clipping through itself and other strange behavior. In order to prevent this from 
    happening, we do spatial hashing. At each time step, we build a hash map that maps a float to a list of 
    point masses; the float represents a 3D box volume and the list of point masses correspond to the 
    point masses in that 3D box volume. After this hashmap is set up, we just have to check each point mass
    in each 3D box volume and apply any corrections to any point mass that are too close to each other.
    Using spatial hashing is more efficient since we do not need to loop through all pairs of point masses,
    compute the distance between them, and check if they are within some threshold distance apart. The hash
    map cuts down the number of checks we have to do!

      Increasing and Decreasing Density:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Increasing density of the cloth results in more folds in the cloth and therefore takes longer to uncurl. On the other hand,
      decreasing density leads to less folds and therefore takes less time to unfold.

      Increasing ks results in faster uncurling of the cloth. This makes sense since the cloth is more stiff, it quickly straightens out.
      Decreasing it takes longer for the cloth to uncurl since it is more flexible.

<h2 align="middle">Part V: Shaders</h2>
  <p>
    After implementing the physics of the cloth, I added shaders to our cloth. I added 5 shaders: 
    diffuse shading, Blinn-Phong shading, texture mapping, displacement and bump mapping, and finally 
    mirror reflections. To write the shaders, I used a GLSL shader. A shader program such as GLSL shader
    works by running in parallel in GPU instead of the CPU. I used two shader types: vertex shaders and
    fragment shaders. Vertex shaders apply transformations to vertices such as their positions and write
    the final position of the vertex to `gl_Position` and forward this data to fragment shaders.
    The fragment shaders compute and write a color into `out_color` which then is the final result that
    we see as a visual effect in our cloth simulator.
  </p>

  <p>The diffuse shader is a shader that is independent of the view direction.</p>
  <div align="middle">
      <img src="part5_diffuse.png" width="480px" />
      <figcaption align="middle">Diffuse shading</figcaption>
  </div>

  <p>The Blinn-Phong shading model is an extension of the diffuse shader in that it takes into account of
    view direction. The model adds ambient lighting and specular reflection in addition to the diffuse
  lighting from the diffuse shader. The model now has additional k constants that can be adjusted; they
represent the weights we can give to each lighting component of the model. The Ia term is the value of the
ambient light and the p value controls how large our specular reflection is.</p>

<p>Texture mapping is straightforward. We map a texture onto the objects in our scene by using the built-in 
  function `texture`. 
</p>
<div align="middle">

  <figcaption align="middle">Texture mapping of Yoshi</figcaption>
</div>

<p>
  Displacement mapping modifies the actual geometry of an object by displacing its vertices based on a height map.
  On the other hand, bump mapping does not change any actual geometry but rather simulates the appearance of surface detail by
  altering the surface normals of the object. Below you can see distinctly see that bump mapping does not change the geometry; it does
  not create the deeper lines that we see with displacement.

  reflected direction. After this, we simply sampled from the environment map.

<p>
  I also added a custom shader. I noticed that in the Blinn-Phong shader, light source angle cannot be changed so 
  I implemented this in this custom shader. I realized that I could just use the color wheel to adjust the angle of the
  light source. Since this is already in clothSimulator.cpp as `u_color`, I added this to the custom shader's fragment
  file and used it to determine light direction. Instead of the vector pointing from the current vertex that is being shaded 
  towards the light position, we simply use `u_color` and normalize it. With this
  implemented, the value in the color wheel chosen by the user will determine the direction of the light source.
