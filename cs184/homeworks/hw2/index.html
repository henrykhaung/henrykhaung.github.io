        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4 mb-5">
          <p>
            In this task, we implemented de Casteljau's algorithm for 1D which
            is useful for finding Bezier curves.
          </p>
          <p>
            de Casteljau's algorithm takes the given control points, inserts a
            point using linear interpolation between each control point, and
            does this recursively until we are left with only one point.
            Essentially, it recursively finds intermediate control points
            between each pair of given control points using linear interpolation
            until only one point remains. This enables for a smooth curve.
          </p>

          <p>
            The implementation is straightforward. Simply iterate through the
            given control points, which is a list of points (x, y) and during
            the iteration, perform linear interpolation between the current
            point and the next point and add this interpolated point to a new
            list of points. This new list containing intermediate points is
            returned. Eventually, this new list will only contain one final
            point that lies on the Bezier curve. This final point is the red
            point shown below in the images.

              If we have 6 control points, we would have to do linear
              interpolation 5 times to get 5 intermediate control points for the
              first step of de Casteljau's algorithm. Then, with these 5 points,
              we would have to do linear interpolation 4 times to get 4
              intermediate points. This repeats until we have one final control
              point as shown above in the images. Essentially, given n points,
              we have to find n-1 intermediate points using linear interpolation
              until we are left with one final point that lies on the Bezier
              curve. This algorithm is used to find the bezier curve as
              indicated by the green curve above.
            </p>

            <p>
              The parameter t ranges from 0 to 1 and determines the position of
              the final intermediate point. For example, when t = 0, this
              corresponds to the starting point. In the gif above, it would be
              the leftmost and bottommost point whereas when t = 1, this
              corresponds to the last point which is the rightmost and
              bottommost point. The parameter t essentially controls how far
              along the curve the interpolated point should be.

        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4 mb-5">
          <p>
            In this task, we implemented a remeshing operation on an edge. This
            operation flips an edge by changing its two endpoints, or vertices,
            to another pair of vertices.
          </p>
          <p>
            To implement this, we wrote down a list of all elements: half-edges,
            vertices, edges, and faces in a simple mesh. The simple mesh
            consists of two triangles glued together by a half-edge. This list
            of elements represents what the elements were originally pointing to
            before the flip operation. This list is important because it ensures
            that we do not forget to reassign the pointers after the flip
            operation. Finally, we perform the flip operation by changing the
            given edge's two vertices to the other two vertices in the simple
            mesh and reassigning all pointers. Keeping track of all elements and
            doing so correctly was crucial in ensuring that they were no bugs in
            this function. This required a complete understanding of the
            halfedge data structure which we did not have initially. We were
            confused with halfedge->vertex; we initially thought
            halfedge->vertex meant the vertex pointed to by the halfedge. After
            fully understanding how the halfedge datastructure worked, we were
            able to easily implement the flip operation.

        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4 mb-5">
          <p>
            In this task, we implemented a remeshing operation on an edge. This
            operation splits the given edge and inserts a new vertex at the
            midpoint and connects the two opposing vertex that were not
            originally connected by the given edge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Implementing this was similar to the implementation of `flipEdge`
            except now, we have to account for new elements. To implement this,
            we first drew a diagram of two triangles connected by a half-edge
            before the split. We labeled every pointer in the diagram before we
            perform the operation just like we did in `flipEdge`: halfedges,
            vertices, edges, and faces. In code, we tracked all these pointers.
            Then, we drew a diagram of what would happen to these two triangles
            after the split operation and labeled what each pointer would point
            to. In code, this is done by using `setNeighbor` function; we also
            had to create new halfedges, new vertices, new edges, and faces
            which is done by calling `newHalfedge`, `newVertex`, `newEdge`, and
            `newFace`. Overall, these diagrams were key in helping us implement
            this function because they helped us easily determine what each
            pointer should be reassigned to.

          <h3>Task 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="text-start taskp mt-4 mb-5">
          <p>
            In this task, we implement loop subdivision which increases the
            number of triangles in the mesh. This way, we can convert a low
            resolution polygon mesh into a higher resolution. This is a similar
            concept to supersampling in antialiasing.
          </p>
          <p>To implement this,</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              We computed new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh
              and stored these new positions in the `newPosition` property of
              the `Vertex` class. To compute a new position, we can use the
              following formula:
              <br />
              (1 - n * u) * original_position + u *
              original_neighbor_position_sum
              <br />
              where n is the degree of the current vertex, u is a constant
              dependent on n, original_position is the original position of the
              current vertex, and original_neighbor_position_sum is the sum of
              all neighboring vertices' positions. When n is 3, then u is 3/16;
              otherwise, u is 3/(8 * n).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Then, we computed the new vertex positions and stored it in
              `newPosition` property of the `Edge` class. The new vertex
              positions are calculated using the following formula:
              <br />
              3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)
              <br />
              where A and B are the positions of the vertices that share the
              edge that connects two triangles together and C and D are the
              positions of the other vertices of each of the two triangles.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Then, we split every edge in the mesh that is old, or in the
              original mesh, using the `splitEdge` function. This returns a
              midpoint vertex which we set its position to the new position we
              stored in `newPosition` of the `Edge` class.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              After this, we flip any new edge that connects an old and new
              vertex.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>We then set the new vertex positions for every vertex.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Following these steps, we were able to make the upsample function
            work. However, it did not produce the expected results. There were
            two bugs. Initially, the upsample function creates a mesh with all
            the faces missing. This was because we did not set any edges to be
            `isNew` after splitting. After this was fixed, we encountered an
            error where the upsampled mesh results in a mesh that is missing
            polygons. This was not a bug from the upsample function but rather a
            bug from our `splitEdge` function. The problem was fixed by properly
            reassigning all the pointers, new and old, of the input mesh of the
            function.
          </p>

          <p>
            After loop subdivision, sharp corners and edges become smoother
            since the number of polygons in the mesh are increased. You can
            reduce this effect by pre-splitting edges near the sharp corners and
            edges.
          </p>

            Similarly, the cube is not symmetrical after repeated subdivisions
            because originally, for each of its faces, it only has one inner
            edge which causes it to be asymmetric. The fix is to pre-split this
            edge for each face and then do subdivision.
